# 1️⃣ 8051 PCB Project – Development Board

---

This project demonstrates the creation of a PCB layout for the **8051 Microcontroller** using **EasyEDA**.  
It serves as an introductory embedded systems project, combining schematic design, simulation, and PCB routing skills.

---

## 📘 Objective

To design and build a functional **8051 microcontroller development board** that includes serial communication, power regulation, external interrupts, and basic I/O headers.

### 🔍 Component-Wise Explanation

#### 🔷 Microcontroller – `STC89C51RD+` (U2)
- Acts as the **brain** of the board.
- A variant of 8051 with internal Flash and UART support.
- Connected to oscillator, reset circuit, and pull-up resistors for stable operation.

#### 🔷 Oscillator Circuit – `11.0592 MHz` Crystal (U3) + `C7`, `C8`
- Provides clock signal to the microcontroller.
- 11.0592 MHz chosen for UART timing compatibility (common baud rates).

#### 🔷 Reset Circuit – Push Button + `R1`, `C6`
- Ensures the controller starts from a known state.
- Manual reset feature using tactile push button switch.

### 🔌 Power Supply Section

#### 🔷 DC Jack & Diode – `DC1`, `D1` (1N4007)
- Input power via adapter.
- Diode for **reverse polarity protection**.

#### 🔷 Voltage Regulator – `U4` (LM7805)
- Converts input 9V–12V to stable **5V output**.
- Capacitors (`C11`, `C12`, `C13`) filter input/output for smooth power.

#### 🔷 Power Indicator – `LED3` + `R8`
- Visual confirmation that board is powered ON.

---

### 🖥️ UART Communication

#### 🔷 RS232 Level Converter – `U1` (MAX232N) + `C1` to `C5`
- Converts microcontroller logic level UART to RS232 level.
- Used for traditional **DB9 serial interface**.

#### 🔷 USB to UART Bridge – `U6` (FT232RL)
- Allows connection with PC via USB.
- Provides alternate modern communication over USB.

#### 🔷 DB9 Connector – `DSUB1`
- Legacy RS232 interface for direct PC/terminal communication.

### 🧭 I/O Ports – `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, `P4` Headers
- All microcontroller ports are broken out.
- Can be connected to sensors, displays, modules, etc.

---

### 🛑 Interrupt Buttons – `INT0`, `INT1` (KEY2, KEY3)
- Trigger external hardware interrupts.
- Useful for real-time event handling (e.g., emergency stop, sensor signal).

---

### 📎 Additional Circuit Features

- **Pull-up resistors** (e.g., `RN1`) for stable logic input.
- **LED1, LED2** for output test indications (connected to GPIO).
- **Switch (SW1)** for user-controlled input or reset.
