## 2️⃣ 7805 Voltage Regulator PCB

This project focuses on designing a **basic voltage regulator circuit** using the **7805 IC**. It converts an unregulated DC input (7–12V) into a stable +5V output.

---

### 📘 Theory

The **7805** is a linear voltage regulator that provides a fixed +5V output. It is ideal for supplying microcontrollers, sensors, and digital circuits.

**Supporting Components:**
- **C1 (Input capacitor)**: Filters input voltage and prevents noise
- **C2 (Output capacitor)**: Enhances regulator stability
- **LED with resistor**: Indicates that the 5V output is active
